# MATLAB_Kauffman_NK_Random_Boolean_Network
The initial version of this is entirely thanks to the work of Christof Teuscher (http://www.teuscher.ch/christof/ext/), who created the original Matlab Random Boolean Network Toolbox (http://www.teuscher.ch/rbntoolbox/). The only changes made so far are to make the toolbox compatible with r2015a. Refer to the Toolbox site for additional overview and documentation information.

Additional updates (or notification of features that still don't work - I haven't tested all of them yet) are welcome.
